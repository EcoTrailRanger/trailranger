### 🌱 Open-Source Nature Trail Cleanup Robot

> Giving nature a robotic hand — cleaning trails, spotting invasives, and inspiring action.

---

## 🤖 What is TrailRanger?
TrailRanger is a rugged, open-source robotic system designed to patrol nature trails, collect human trash, sort it, and identify invasive plant species using AI. It uses 5G to stream data in real-time, enabling community volunteers to help label trash and plants to improve AI accuracy — and to alert authorities when cleanup support is needed.

**No profit. No patents. Just purpose.**

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Autonomous or semi-autonomous trail navigation
- Trash detection and pickup via camera + robotic arm
- Onboard waste sorting (metal/plastic/general)
- Real-time image analysis using YOLOv8 or similar
- Invasive species detection + geo-tagging
- Cloud sync via 5G for data uploads, alerts, and volunteer-powered AI training
- Fully modular and repairable hardware
